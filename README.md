# ImprovedSimonSays
The goal was to develop the dexterity of hands and abilities of memorization for children as well as adults.
It was done by sweet expansion of the traditional Simon Says game, by adding more musical instruments.
The application includes records list, animations, Hebrew support, dialogs, widgets, multi-threading, and
graphical design.
